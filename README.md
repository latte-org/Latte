# Latte üìù‚ú®

**Latte** is an open-source LaTeX editing environment that combines the power of a code editor (like Overleaf) with the ease of a Word-style interface. It‚Äôs designed for users of all levels ‚Äî from LaTeX veterans to first-time users ‚Äî to write beautiful documents faster and with more flexibility.


## üåü Project Highlights

- üß† **Live LaTeX Editor** ‚Äì Real-time LaTeX editing with syntax highlighting and preview
- üé® **Visual (WYSIWYG) Editor** ‚Äì Word-style UI for inserting sections, equations, images, and more
- üì§ **Export Options** ‚Äì Download as `.tex`, `.pdf`, or zipped project
- üìÅ **Built-in Templates** ‚Äì Quickly start with pre-made document templates (e.g., academic papers, CVs)
- üîå **Extensible Architecture** ‚Äì Open-source and modular, ready for plugins and custom templates


## üß† Why TexFlow?

LaTeX is powerful but can be intimidating. TexFlow bridges the gap:

- For experienced users: it‚Äôs a flexible Overleaf-like platform with full code control.
- For beginners: it provides Word-style controls that generate LaTeX behind the scenes.

TexFlow helps you **focus on content ‚Äî not syntax**.
